   -annotatePeaks.pl finds motifs from both + and - strands


** 16/2/2021 **

-for now 3 clusters
-absolute value of distance from TSS = sort of validation metric
-top frequently occuring motifs 
-remove similar column as duplicate columns don't have any more information
-plot color coded module vs motifs 

X=Seq
M=Model
m=Total No. of Topics

P(X|M) = sum over m P(X,T|M)

P(X,T)=P(X|T)P(T)

[DOUBT] +/- strand
