3. [Strand info during annotation] https://www.biostars.org/p/251361/
   -annotatePeaks.pl finds motifs from both + and - strands

-for now 3 clusters
-absolute value of distance from TSS = kind of validation metric
-top frequently occuring motifs 
-remove similar column as duplicate columns don't have any more information
-plot color coded module vs motifs 

X=Seq
M=Model
m=Total No. of Topics

P(X|M) = sum over m P(X,T|M)

P(X,T)=P(X|T)P(T)

[TASKS]
* duplicate motifs were identified
* iterations (int, optional) â€“ Maximum number of iterations through the corpus when inferring the topic distribution of a corpus
* https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldamodel.html

[Questions]
1. which strand to use (+/-)? right now, annotatePeaks.pl finds motifs from both + and - strands
2. How to measure similarity between two motif columns?
3. Plot

don't

Train different models by increasing number of topics
rank each model by following metric
likelihood of product of probality of each seq condition on model
validation metric=prod over seq[P(Xi|M)]
P(Xi|M)=sum over topic[P(X,Ti|M)]
P(Xi,T)=P(Xi|T)P(T)
we expect the value of validation metric to increase with increasing no. of topics
validation metric: higher value is better

Do this for example data as well as on real data

Steps to use homer for example data:
* background file: /home/vanka/siddharth/leelavati_narlikar_project/homer/data/genomes/hg38/preparsed/hg38.200.seq
* convert need to convert background into 'fasta' format
* use following command 
>>findMotifs.pl <targetSequences.fa> fasta <output directory> -fasta <background.fa> [options]
targetSequences.fa = example.fa
background.fa = hg38.200.seq

Future bigger picture:
cisTopic for single cells and combine it with LDA for DNA in single cell
